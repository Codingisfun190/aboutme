        Hello! My name is Samuel Kim and I am currently learning and studying
        front end web development. So far it has been a challenging but
        rewarding journey. Samuel enjoys learning new ways to simplify lines of
        code, and is eager to learn more.
      </p>

        Samuel has an associates degree in Applied Exercise Science. While these
        fields may seem unrelated, the amount of client satisfaction, trouble
        shooting and planning required in both fields has helped bridge the gap.
        He has also worked in management positions in retail for Rite-Aid
        Pharmacy and Walgreens Pharmacy.
      </p>

        Samuel also enjoys working out, playing video games, and watching
        football. His favorite football team is the Baltimore Ravens.
